This is a budding, small-scale nail lacquer database project.

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, organized database containing information about different kinds of nail lacquers. 

Further information about the organizational structure can be derived from the Data Dictionary.  

This project is authored by Clara Smith, an undergraduate data science student at the university of Arkansas.
