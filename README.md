# Introduction
This is a budding, small-scale nail lacquer database project. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, organized database containing information about different kinds of nail lacquers. 

## What is a nail lacquer?
**Nail polish** is a general term that refers to any paint-like coating that is applied to the nails for color and durability. Roughly, nail polish is divided into three categories:

1. **Nail Lacquer** - A solvent-based coating, typically with a film-forming agent. Common solvents include ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, while nitrocellulose is the most common film-forming agent. Nail Lacquer is commonly found in drugstores.

2. **Nail Gel** - A liquid paint that hardens underneath ultraviolet or LED lighting. Typically composed of acrylate monomers, these monomers polyermize underneath ultraviolet lighting, creating a long lasting, very durable film. Nail Gels can be purchased for at-home usage, but are primarily done at a salon.

3. **Nail Dip Powder** - A powdered form of lacquer also made from acrylates. A base coat is applied to the nail plate, in which the nail is dipped into finely milled, pigmented acrylic powder and brushed with an activator. 

This database primarily concerns itself with the organization of **nail lacquer**, as opposed to acrylate-based polishes. 

# Why nail lacquer?
To put it briefly:
- Nail lacquer is not just *like* paint, but *is* paint. Nail lacquer is a combination of pigments, binders, and solvents, in which once the solvent evaporates, a hard colored coating is left behind. 
- Just as artists are very meticulous about the way that they categorize the paints in their collections, nail lacquerists (those who collect nail polish) are likewise very particular about the colors that they collect, wear, and organize. 
- Nail lacquerist hobby culture is very involved in nail polish organization, in which tools like spreadsheets and swatch sticks are kept in order for each collector to keep track of their collections.
- Right now, even though there has been attempts to create organized nail polish databases, what currently exists is either no longer maintained, or only exists as standalone mobile applications. 

# The Goals:
## In descending priority:
1. Design and implement a database, with an appropriate schema, such that data about individual nail polishes are neatly organized and can be queried. 
2. Implement a front-end web interface such that the data in such a database can be neatly displayed.
3. Implement a front-end web interface such that the data in such a database can be neatly displayed, *and other people can interact with said database.*
